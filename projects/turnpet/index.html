		<p>a microgame three years in the making that only took twenty-one hours to make (i kept a tally)</p>
		<p>it's more of a practice exercise than an actual game - the code was hacked together slapdash and can be very wasteful</p>
		<p>but it was very useful in getting more comfortable with the haxe language and heaps in particular</p>
		<br/><br/>
		<p>build your own turnip friend and playrock paper scissors with him, all so he can pursue his deep-rooted musical ambitions</p>
		<br/><br/>
		<p>you can peruse my nightmare spaghetti code here:</p>
